# Progress: Multi-Tenant ERP-Style Web Application

## 1. Current Status

The project has most recently completed an enhancement to the **Report Violation** page to improve mobile usability by adding direct camera access.

Prior to this, a significant **Dashboard Navigation Refactor & UI Enhancements** initiative was completed. This involved moving from a tab-based navigation system to a global, role-aware drawer navigation, implementing breadcrumbs, and enhancing overview pages.

## 2. What Works / Completed (Newest First)

- **Mobile-Friendly Violation Reporting (Completed 2025-07-12):**
    - **Objective:** Enhance the "Report Violation" page for better mobile use by adding a direct camera access option.
    - **Change:** Modified `src/pages/PropertyManager/ReportViolationPage.tsx`.
    - **Details:**
        - Added an `IconButton` with a `PhotoCamera` icon alongside the existing "Upload File" button.
        - The new button uses an input with the `capture="environment"` attribute to directly launch the device's rear camera on mobile browsers, streamlining the process of taking and uploading violation photos.
        - The original file selection functionality is preserved for gallery uploads.

- **Dynamic Card Headers & Conditional Layout (Completed 2025-06-25):**
    - **Objective:** Update dashboard panels to show dynamic titles/icons and conditionally render layouts for specific routes.
    - **Change:** Modified `src/components/Dashboard/PropertyManagerDashboardPanel.tsx`.
    - **Details:**
        - Implemented a dynamic `CardHeader` that displays the title and icon from `navigationConfig.ts` based on the current route.
        - Added a conditional check to provide a full-screen view for the AI Assistant (`/dashboard/property-manager/ai-assistant`) by rendering its content outside the main `Card` wrapper, allowing it to take up the full content area. Other routes retain the card-based layout.

- **Resident Testimonial Refactor (Completed 2025-06-15):**
    - **Objective:** Refactor the static testimonial section into a reusable, theme-aware slider component.
    - **Change:** Created `src/components/Resident/ResidentReviewSlider.tsx` and updated `src/components/Resident/ResidentDashboard.tsx`.
    - **Details:**
        - Created a new `ResidentReviewSlider` component to display testimonials in a "Google Reviews" style slider.
        - The component is built with MUI components (`Card`, `Avatar`, `Rating`, etc.) and is fully theme-aware.
        - Implemented a custom slider using `useState` and `IconButton` to avoid new dependencies.
        - Replaced the old static testimonial layout in `ResidentDashboard.tsx` with the new slider component.

- **AppBar Layout Refactor (Completed 2025-06-15):**
    - **Objective:** Refactor the `AppBarComponent` to a more conventional left-drawer oriented design.
    - **Change:** Modified `src/components/Layout/AppBarComponent.tsx`.
    - **Details:** Moved the drawer-toggling `MenuIcon` to the far-left of the `AppBar`. Centered the application logo and title. Removed the redundant user avatar trigger from the `AppBar`, as the user's profile is already in the drawer. The right side of the `AppBar` now only contains the `Notifications` component.
- **Demo Page Enhancement (Completed 2025-06-14):**
    - **Objective:** Extend the MUI component showcase page with more helper and overlay components.
    - **Change:** Modified `src/pages/DemoPage.tsx`.
    - **Details:** Added a new "Helpers & Overlays" section demonstrating `Popover`, `Backdrop`, and `Popper`. Enhanced `Tooltip` examples, adjusting their layout to a vertical stack for clearer presentation. Replaced deprecated `Grid` with `Stack` for layout, resolving TS errors.
- **Service Request Form Auto-select First Vehicle (Completed 2025-06-10):**
    - **Objective:** Automatically select the first vehicle in the service request form if the resident has vehicles and none is yet selected.
    - **Change:** Modified `src/components/Resident/CreateServiceRequestForm.tsx`.
    - **Details:** Added a `useEffect` hook that listens to `residentProfileData` and `selectedVehicle`. If `residentProfileData.vehicles` is populated and no vehicle is currently selected, it sets `selectedVehicle` to the first vehicle in the array.
- **Service Request Form Phone Pre-population (Completed 2025-06-10):**
    - **Objective:** Enhance the pre-population of the phone number field in the resident service request form.
    - **Change:** Modified `src/components/Resident/CreateServiceRequestForm.tsx`.
    - **Details:** The `useEffect` hook responsible for setting initial form values (name, email, phone) was updated. It now checks `currentUser.phoneNumber` (from Firebase Auth) as a fallback if `residentProfileData.phone` (from Firestore) is not available. This increases the chances of the phone number being pre-filled for the user.
- **Dashboard Navigation Refactor & UI Enhancements (Completed 2025-06-09):**
    - **Objective:** Improve dashboard navigation scalability, mobile usability, and overall user experience.
    - **Navigation System:**
        - Replaced tab-based navigation with a global drawer in `AppBarComponent.tsx`.
        - Drawer links are dynamically generated from `src/config/navigationConfig.ts` based on user roles.
        - Content from former tabs now resides in distinct routed view components.
    - **Routing:**
        - `src/routes.tsx` restructured with nested routes under `/dashboard` for new views.
        - `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` updated to be a layout component with an `<Outlet />` and default view redirection logic.
    - **Layout & Context:**
        - `OrganizationManagerDashboardPanel.tsx` and `PropertyManagerDashboardPanel.tsx` refactored into layout components providing context (`OrgManagerContext`, `PropertyManagerContext`) for selected organization/property to child views.
        - `ResidentDashboard.tsx` refactored into a layout component for resident views, including the testimonial section.
        - `AdminDashboardPanel.tsx` simplified as its content moved to routed views.
    - **UI Enhancements:**
        - **Breadcrumbs:** `src/components/Layout/BreadcrumbsComponent.tsx` added and integrated into `Dashboard.tsx` to display on all authenticated dashboard pages.
        - **Initial Page Navigation:** `AdminOverviewView.tsx`, `OrgManagerOverviewView.tsx`, `PropertyManagerOverviewView.tsx`, and `ResidentProfileManagement.tsx` (now the resident's initial page) enhanced with "Quick Navigation" cards/links.
        - **Testimonial Sections:** Added back to `PropertyManagerDashboardPanel.tsx` and `ResidentDashboard.tsx` layouts.
        - **Layout Components:** Ensured consistent use of MUI `Box` and `Stack` for new layouts and refactored sections.
        - **Resident Default:** "My Profile" set as the default landing page for residents.
        - Corrected `phoneNumber` to `phone` in `ResidentProfileManagement.tsx`.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level from `projectRoadmap.md` and recent work)

1.  **Thorough Testing of New Navigation & UI:** (Immediate next step)
    *   Verify all drawer links, breadcrumbs, and navigation cards for all user roles.
    *   Test responsiveness and context providers.
2.  **Dashboard Data Visualizations & Statistics - Phase 1.C (Phoenix API Integration):** (As previously listed)
3.  **Phoenix Integration - Remaining Core Tasks:** (As previously listed)
4.  **Dashboard Statistics - Denormalization & Optimization:** (As previously listed)
5.  **Review and Refine User Experience for Dashboards (Post-Refactor):**
    *   Gather feedback on the new drawer navigation and breadcrumbs.
    *   Consider further refinements to overview pages or navigation flow.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **Phoenix API Documentation for Aggregated Queries:** Still a blocker for Phase 1.C of dashboard statistics.
