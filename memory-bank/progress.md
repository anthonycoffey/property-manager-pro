# Progress: Multi-Tenant ERP-Style Web Application

## 1. Current Status

The project has most recently completed a significant **Dashboard Navigation Refactor and UI Enhancements** initiative. This involved moving from a tab-based navigation system within individual dashboard panels to a global, role-aware drawer navigation. Additionally, breadcrumbs were implemented for better contextual awareness, and initial/overview pages for each role were enhanced with quick navigation links. Layouts were updated to prefer MUI `Box` and `Stack` components.

Prior to this, Phase 1 of "Dashboard Data Visualizations & Statistics" (non-Phoenix data) was completed, along with login page accessibility and Twilio integration.

## 2. What Works / Completed (Newest First)

- **Demo Page Enhancement (Completed 2025-06-14):**
    - **Objective:** Extend the MUI component showcase page with more helper and overlay components.
    - **Change:** Modified `src/pages/DemoPage.tsx`.
    - **Details:** Added a new "Helpers & Overlays" section demonstrating `Popover`, `Backdrop`, and `Popper`. Enhanced `Tooltip` examples, adjusting their layout to a vertical stack for clearer presentation. Replaced deprecated `Grid` with `Stack` for layout, resolving TS errors.
- **Service Request Form Auto-select First Vehicle (Completed 2025-06-10):**
    - **Objective:** Automatically select the first vehicle in the service request form if the resident has vehicles and none is yet selected.
    - **Change:** Modified `src/components/Resident/CreateServiceRequestForm.tsx`.
    - **Details:** Added a `useEffect` hook that listens to `residentProfileData` and `selectedVehicle`. If `residentProfileData.vehicles` is populated and no vehicle is currently selected, it sets `selectedVehicle` to the first vehicle in the array.
- **Service Request Form Phone Pre-population (Completed 2025-06-10):**
    - **Objective:** Enhance the pre-population of the phone number field in the resident service request form.
    - **Change:** Modified `src/components/Resident/CreateServiceRequestForm.tsx`.
    - **Details:** The `useEffect` hook responsible for setting initial form values (name, email, phone) was updated. It now checks `currentUser.phoneNumber` (from Firebase Auth) as a fallback if `residentProfileData.phone` (from Firestore) is not available. This increases the chances of the phone number being pre-filled for the user.
- **Dashboard Navigation Refactor & UI Enhancements (Completed 2025-06-09):**
    - **Objective:** Improve dashboard navigation scalability, mobile usability, and overall user experience.
    - **Navigation System:**
        - Replaced tab-based navigation with a global drawer in `AppBarComponent.tsx`.
        - Drawer links are dynamically generated from `src/config/navigationConfig.ts` based on user roles.
        - Content from former tabs now resides in distinct routed view components.
    - **Routing:**
        - `src/routes.tsx` restructured with nested routes under `/dashboard` for new views.
        - `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` updated to be a layout component with an `<Outlet />` and default view redirection logic.
    - **Layout & Context:**
        - `OrganizationManagerDashboardPanel.tsx` and `PropertyManagerDashboardPanel.tsx` refactored into layout components providing context (`OrgManagerContext`, `PropertyManagerContext`) for selected organization/property to child views.
        - `ResidentDashboard.tsx` refactored into a layout component for resident views, including the testimonial section.
        - `AdminDashboardPanel.tsx` simplified as its content moved to routed views.
    - **UI Enhancements:**
        - **Breadcrumbs:** `src/components/Layout/BreadcrumbsComponent.tsx` added and integrated into `Dashboard.tsx` to display on all authenticated dashboard pages.
        - **Initial Page Navigation:** `AdminOverviewView.tsx`, `OrgManagerOverviewView.tsx`, `PropertyManagerOverviewView.tsx`, and `ResidentProfileManagement.tsx` (now the resident's initial page) enhanced with "Quick Navigation" cards/links.
        - **Testimonial Sections:** Added back to `PropertyManagerDashboardPanel.tsx` and `ResidentDashboard.tsx` layouts.
        - **Layout Components:** Ensured consistent use of MUI `Box` and `Stack` for new layouts and refactored sections.
        - **Resident Default:** "My Profile" set as the default landing page for residents.
        - Corrected `phoneNumber` to `phone` in `ResidentProfileManagement.tsx`.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level from `projectRoadmap.md` and recent work)

1.  **Thorough Testing of New Navigation & UI:** (Immediate next step)
    *   Verify all drawer links, breadcrumbs, and navigation cards for all user roles.
    *   Test responsiveness and context providers.
2.  **Dashboard Data Visualizations & Statistics - Phase 1.C (Phoenix API Integration):** (As previously listed)
3.  **Phoenix Integration - Remaining Core Tasks:** (As previously listed)
4.  **Dashboard Statistics - Denormalization & Optimization:** (As previously listed)
5.  **Review and Refine User Experience for Dashboards (Post-Refactor):**
    *   Gather feedback on the new drawer navigation and breadcrumbs.
    *   Consider further refinements to overview pages or navigation flow.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **Phoenix API Documentation for Aggregated Queries:** Still a blocker for Phase 1.C of dashboard statistics.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions (Newest First)

- **Dashboard Navigation & Layout (2025-06-09):**
    - Shifted from tabs to a global drawer with routed views.
    - Introduced `BreadcrumbsComponent`.
    - Enhanced overview pages with quick navigation elements.
    - Refactored role-specific dashboard panels (`OrganizationManagerDashboardPanel`, `PropertyManagerDashboardPanel`, `ResidentDashboard`) to serve as layout components with `<Outlet />` and, where applicable, context providers.
    - Standardized on `Box` and `Stack` for new layouts.
- **Dashboard Statistics Aggregation Strategy (2025-06-03):** (As previously listed)
- **Dashboard Layout Components (Preference Reinforced 2025-06-09):** Prioritize MUI `Box` (with Flexbox) and `Stack`.
- **Charting Library (2025-06-03):** (As previously listed)
- **(Older decisions as previously listed)**
