# Progress: Multi-Tenant ERP-Style Web Application

## 1. Current Status: RBAC & Firestore Implementation (As of 2025-05-23)

The project is actively implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Cloud Firestore for the multi-tenant architecture, following the plan in `docs/02-rbac-firestore-implementation.md`.

*   **Date of this update:** 2025-05-23

## 2. What Works / Completed

*   **Project Definition:**
    *   `projectRoadmap.md` has been reviewed and serves as the primary guide for development.
*   **Core Memory Bank Documentation Established:**
    *   `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md` are established and updated.
*   **Authentication Redirection Implemented:** Configured `src/components/LoginForm.tsx` and `src/components/SignupForm.tsx` to redirect users to the `/dashboard` page upon successful login or registration.
*   **RBAC and Firestore Implementation Plan Documented:** Created `docs/02-rbac-firestore-implementation.md` detailing the comprehensive plan for multi-tenant RBAC and Firestore integration.
*   **Phase 1: Firebase Project Setup & Initial Firestore Structure:**
    *   Confirmed Firebase project initialization and Firestore enablement.
*   **Phase 2: Firebase Authentication & Custom Claims:**
    *   **Updated `processSignUp` Cloud Function (`functions/src/index.ts`):** Migrated from a blocking `beforeUserCreated` trigger to a non-blocking `functions.auth.user().onCreate` (1st gen) trigger. Implemented custom claims logic to assign `admin: true` and `accessLevel: 9` for users with `@admin.example.com` emails, and default `resident` roles for others. Resolved TypeScript errors related to `functions.auth` and implicit `any` types by correctly importing `functions` and explicitly typing `user` as `admin.auth.UserRecord`.
    *   **Replaced `firebase-functions/logger` with `console.log`:** All `logger.info` and `logger.error` calls in `functions/src/index.ts` have been replaced with `console.log` and `console.error` respectively, as per user instruction.
    *   Resolved TypeScript module resolution errors for Firebase Functions v2 `identity` module. (Note: This specific resolution is now superseded by the change to `onCreate` but kept for historical context of previous issues).
    *   Updated `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` and `src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` to fetch and expose custom claims.
*   **Phase 3: Firestore Security Rules:**
    *   Implemented comprehensive multi-tenant and RBAC security rules in `firestore.rules`.
*   **Phase 4: Frontend Integration & UI Adaptation:**
    *   Updated `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` to enforce route protection based on roles and IDs.
    *   Modified `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` for conditional UI rendering based on user roles.
*   **Phase 5 (Partial): Initial Feature Development (Admin Dashboard - Property Manager CRUD):**
    *   Created `src/components/Admin` directory and `src/components/Admin/PropertyManagerManagement.tsx` component.
    *   Implemented `createPropertyManager`, `updatePropertyManager`, and `deletePropertyManager` Cloud Functions in `functions/src/index.ts`.
    *   Integrated the "Add New Property Manager" form in `src/components/Admin/PropertyManagerManagement.tsx` to interact with the `createPropertyManager` Cloud Function.
    *   Added `/admin/property-managers` route to `src/routes.tsx` protected by `ProtectedRoute`.
*   **Resolved Firebase Admin SDK Initialization Error:** Changed `import * as admin from 'firebase-admin';` to `import admin from 'firebase-admin';` in `functions/src/index.ts` to resolve `TypeError: admin.initializeApp is not a function` during Firebase Functions deployment in an ES module environment.
*   **Removed Token Refresh Mechanism from `processSignUp` (2025-05-23):**
    *   Modified `functions/src/index.ts` in the `processSignUp` function to completely remove any explicit server-side mechanism for signaling client-side token refresh (this included removing the previously implemented Firestore `userTokenRefreshFlags` and the original Realtime Database calls).
    *   Removed the security rules for the `userTokenRefreshFlags` collection from `firestore.rules`.
    *   This simplifies the `processSignUp` function and ensures the "Can't determine Firebase Database URL" error (related to the initial Realtime Database attempt) remains resolved. The client will now be solely responsible for its token refresh strategy.
*   **Resolved Authentication Race Condition (2025-05-23):**
    *   Successfully investigated and fixed a race condition in `src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` that caused users to be incorrectly redirected from protected routes on initial login.
    *   The fix involved refactoring `AuthProvider.tsx` to use a two-stage `useEffect` approach for more robust management of loading and user authentication states. This ensures that `ProtectedRoute.tsx` evaluates access based on complete and current authentication context.
    *   `ProtectedRoute.tsx` was restored to its full functionality (role and ID checks) after the fix.
    *   Console logs used for debugging were cleaned up from `AuthProvider.tsx` and `ProtectedRoute.tsx`.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level from `projectRoadmap.md`)

The remaining application functionality includes:

*   **A. Authentication & Authorization:** (Core setup complete, ongoing refinement)
*   **B. Admin Dashboard:**
    *   Complete Property Managers Management (listing, editing, deleting UI).
    *   Properties Management (CRUD).
    *   Residents Management (View, Edit, Delete for support).
*   **C. Property Manager Dashboard:**
    *   View assigned properties.
    *   Manage residents for their properties.
    *   Manage invitations.
    *   Track service requests.
*   **D. Resident Dashboard:**
    *   View property details.
    *   Manage profile (vehicle info).
    *   Submit and track service requests.
*   **E. Core Systems & Features:**
    *   **Data Models in Firestore:** (Initial implementation complete, ongoing refinement as features are built).
    *   **Invitation System:** (Full implementation pending).
    *   **Service Request System:** (Full implementation pending).
    *   **Firebase Cloud Functions for:** CRM Integration, Email Sending, CSV Processing, QR Code Generation, Subscription Management (all pending).

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **None at this stage.** The "Can't determine Firebase Database URL" error in `processSignUp` has been resolved. The TypeScript error related to `functions.auth` was previously resolved.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **Initial Decision (from `projectRoadmap.md`):** Adopt React 19 with Server Components and Firebase as the core stack.
*   **Initial Decision (from `.clinerules`):** Implement and maintain a "Memory Bank" documentation system.
*   **2025-05-22:** Decided to use Highcharts for analytics and reporting features.
*   **2025-05-23:** Finalized the detailed multi-tenant database architecture for Firestore and the Firebase Auth custom claims strategy. This adopts a hierarchical model based on organizations and array-based roles. The canonical documentation for this is in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`, with `memory-bank/projectRoadmap.md` updated to reflect this and refer to `systemPatterns.md`.
*   **2025-05-23:** Resolved Firebase Functions v2 `identity` module import issue by identifying `beforeUserCreated` as the correct function for user creation triggers and updating `tsconfig.json` for `nodenext` compatibility. (Note: This specific resolution is now superseded by the change to `onCreate` but kept for historical context of previous issues).
*   **2025-05-23:** Updated `apphosting.yaml` to include `build` and `release` configurations for Firebase App Hosting, ensuring correct deployment of the Vite application.
*   **2025-05-23:** Resolved `TypeError: admin.initializeApp is not a function` by changing `firebase-admin` import in `functions/src/index.ts` from `import * as admin from 'firebase-admin';` to `import admin from 'firebase-admin';`.
*   **2025-05-23:** Switched Firebase user creation trigger from blocking `beforeUserCreated` to non-blocking `functions.auth.user().onCreate` (1st gen) in `functions/src/index.ts`. Implemented custom claims for admin users. **The explicit server-side token refresh signaling mechanism in `processSignUp` was removed entirely.** Replaced `firebase-functions/logger` with `console.log` and `console.error`.
*   **2025-05-23:** Resolved TypeScript error `Property 'auth' does not exist` in `functions/src/index.ts` by explicitly importing `auth` from `firebase-functions` for v1 function compatibility.
*   **2025-05-23 (Auth Race Condition):** Identified and resolved a race condition in the client-side authentication flow. Refactored `src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` to use a two-stage `useEffect` pattern. The first `useEffect` subscribes to `onAuthStateChanged` and updates a raw `firebaseUser` state. The second `useEffect` reacts to `firebaseUser` changes, manages a `loading` state explicitly during asynchronous claim fetching and context updates, ensuring that `ProtectedRoute` components receive a consistent and complete auth state. This fixed issues with premature redirects.

## 6. Immediate Next Steps

1.  **Complete Admin Dashboard - Property Manager CRUD:** Focus on implementing the UI for listing, editing, and deleting property managers in `src/components/Admin/PropertyManagerManagement.tsx`.
2.  **Continue with Project Roadmap:** Begin implementing other core features as prioritized.
