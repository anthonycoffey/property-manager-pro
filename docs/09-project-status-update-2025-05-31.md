# Project Status Update - May 31, 2025

The project is well underway with core functionalities like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), multi-tenant Firestore database structure, and a comprehensive invitation system (including advanced "Campaigns") largely complete and tested.

## Recent Major Completions:

*   **Custom GPTChat Model Integration (Completed 2025-05-31):** The rescuelink chatbot has been successfully migrated and integrated into the application for all user roles (Residents, Property Managers, Organization Managers, and Admins).
*   **Resident Invitation Campaigns Feature (Completed & Refined 2025-05-29 to 2025-05-30):**
    *   A robust "Campaigns" system is in place for resident invitations, supporting both bulk CSV imports and shareable public links/QR codes with usage limits and expiration dates.
    *   The **Public Campaign Link Flow** was significantly re-architected and fixed, now using a frontend handler page ([`PublicCampaignHandlerPage.tsx`](src/pages/PublicCampaignHandlerPage.tsx:1)) and a new callable Cloud Function ([`processPublicCampaignLink.ts`](functions/src/callable/processPublicCampaignLink.ts:1)).
    *   The **Public Campaign Sign-up Flow** was debugged and fixed, ensuring users can successfully sign up via public links and have their roles and profiles correctly established.
    *   **Campaign Management UI** is now available for Property Managers ([`PropertyCampaignsView.tsx`](src/components/PropertyManager/Campaigns/PropertyCampaignsView.tsx:1)), Organization Managers ([`OrgManagerCampaignsView.tsx`](src/components/OrganizationManager/Campaigns/OrgManagerCampaignsView.tsx:1)), and Admins ([`AdminCampaignsView.tsx`](src/components/Admin/Campaigns/AdminCampaignsView.tsx:1)).
    *   The [`CampaignsTable.tsx`](src/components/PropertyManager/Campaigns/CampaignsTable.tsx:1) now includes full actions (Edit, Deactivate, Reactivate, Delete) and a "View Details" link to a campaign details page.
    *   A **Campaign Reactivation Feature** was added, allowing inactive campaigns to be set to 'active'.
*   **Core User Roles & Management:**
    *   Super Admin (`admin`), Organization Manager (`organization_manager`), Property Manager (`property_manager`), and Resident (`resident`) roles are defined with associated access controls.
    *   Admins can manage Organization Managers, including assigning them to organizations ([`OrganizationManagerAssignments.tsx`](src/components/Admin/OrganizationManagerAssignments.tsx:1)).
    *   Organization Managers can manage Property Managers and properties within their assigned organizations.
    *   Property Managers can manage properties and residents.
*   **Authentication & User Experience:**
    *   Lost Password functionality is implemented ([`LostPasswordPage.tsx`](src/pages/LostPasswordPage.tsx:1)).
    *   Theme (dark/light mode) preference is persisted in `localStorage`.
    *   Google Places API Autocomplete for addresses has been refactored and improved.
*   **Documentation:** The [`projectRoadmap.md`](memory-bank/projectRoadmap.md:1) has been extended, and all Memory Bank files ([`projectbrief.md`](memory-bank/projectbrief.md:1), [`productContext.md`](memory-bank/productContext.md:1), [`activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md:1), [`systemPatterns.md`](memory-bank/systemPatterns.md:1), [`techContext.md`](memory-bank/techContext.md:1), [`progress.md`](memory-bank/progress.md:1)) are actively maintained.

## Ongoing Work:

*   **Phoenix Integration:** This is a key focus, involving:
    *   Job querying by Resident, Property, and Organization.
    *   Service request dispatch to Phoenix.
    *   Services querying from Phoenix.
*   **Dashboard Data Visualizations & Statistics:** Initial implementations are underway to provide metrics for all user roles using Highcharts, including campaign performance data.

## What's Next (High-Level):

*   Continued development of the Phoenix Integration.
*   Further implementation of dashboard visualizations and statistics.
*   The [`projectRoadmap.md`](memory-bank/projectRoadmap.md:1) contains more detailed plans for upcoming features.

Overall, the project has made significant strides, particularly in establishing the core multi-tenant architecture, RBAC, and the advanced resident invitation campaign system. The current focus is on integrating with Phoenix and enhancing dashboard analytics.
