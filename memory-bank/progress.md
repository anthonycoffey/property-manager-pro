# Progress: Multi-Tenant ERP-Style Web Application

## 1. Current Status: RBAC & Firestore Implementation (As of 2025-05-23)

The project is actively implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Cloud Firestore for the multi-tenant architecture, following the plan in `docs/02-rbac-firestore-implementation.md`.

*   **Date of this update:** 2025-05-23

## 2. What Works / Completed

*   **Project Definition:**
    *   `projectRoadmap.md` has been reviewed and serves as the primary guide for development.
*   **Core Memory Bank Documentation Established:**
    *   `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md` are established and updated.
*   **Authentication Redirection Implemented:** Configured `src/components/LoginForm.tsx` and `src/components/SignupForm.tsx` to redirect users to the `/dashboard` page upon successful login or registration.
*   **RBAC and Firestore Implementation Plan Documented:** Created `docs/02-rbac-firestore-implementation.md` detailing the comprehensive plan for multi-tenant RBAC and Firestore integration.
*   **Phase 1: Firebase Project Setup & Initial Firestore Structure:**
    *   Confirmed Firebase project initialization and Firestore enablement.
*   **Phase 2: Firebase Authentication & Custom Claims:**
    *   Implemented `onUserCreate` Cloud Function (`functions/src/index.ts`) to set default `resident` roles and create user profiles.
    *   Resolved TypeScript module resolution errors for Firebase Functions v2 `identity` module.
    *   Updated `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` and `src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` to fetch and expose custom claims.
*   **Phase 3: Firestore Security Rules:**
    *   Implemented comprehensive multi-tenant and RBAC security rules in `firestore.rules`.
*   **Phase 4: Frontend Integration & UI Adaptation:**
    *   Updated `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` to enforce route protection based on roles and IDs.
    *   Modified `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` for conditional UI rendering based on user roles.
*   **Phase 5 (Partial): Initial Feature Development (Admin Dashboard - Property Manager CRUD):**
    *   Created `src/components/Admin` directory and `src/components/Admin/PropertyManagerManagement.tsx` component.
    *   Implemented `createPropertyManager`, `updatePropertyManager`, and `deletePropertyManager` Cloud Functions in `functions/src/index.ts`.
    *   Integrated the "Add New Property Manager" form in `src/components/Admin/PropertyManagerManagement.tsx` to interact with the `createPropertyManager` Cloud Function.
    *   Added `/admin/property-managers` route to `src/routes.tsx` protected by `ProtectedRoute`.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level from `projectRoadmap.md`)

The remaining application functionality includes:

*   **A. Authentication & Authorization:** (Core setup complete, ongoing refinement)
*   **B. Admin Dashboard:**
    *   Complete Property Managers Management (listing, editing, deleting UI).
    *   Properties Management (CRUD).
    *   Residents Management (View, Edit, Delete for support).
*   **C. Property Manager Dashboard:**
    *   View assigned properties.
    *   Manage residents for their properties.
    *   Manage invitations.
    *   Track service requests.
*   **D. Resident Dashboard:**
    *   View property details.
    *   Manage profile (vehicle info).
    *   Submit and track service requests.
*   **E. Core Systems & Features:**
    *   **Data Models in Firestore:** (Initial implementation complete, ongoing refinement as features are built).
    *   **Invitation System:** (Full implementation pending).
    *   **Service Request System:** (Full implementation pending).
    *   **Firebase Cloud Functions for:** CRM Integration, Email Sending, CSV Processing, QR Code Generation, Subscription Management (all pending).

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **None at this stage.** All immediate compilation issues for Cloud Functions have been resolved.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **Initial Decision (from `projectRoadmap.md`):** Adopt React 19 with Server Components and Firebase as the core stack.
*   **Initial Decision (from `.clinerules`):** Implement and maintain a "Memory Bank" documentation system.
*   **2025-05-22:** Decided to use Highcharts for analytics and reporting features.
*   **2025-05-23:** Finalized the detailed multi-tenant database architecture for Firestore and the Firebase Auth custom claims strategy. This adopts a hierarchical model based on organizations and array-based roles. The canonical documentation for this is in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`, with `memory-bank/projectRoadmap.md` updated to reflect this and refer to `systemPatterns.md`.
*   **2025-05-23:** Resolved Firebase Functions v2 `identity` module import issue by identifying `beforeUserCreated` as the correct function for user creation triggers and updating `tsconfig.json` for `nodenext` compatibility.
*   **2025-05-23:** Updated `apphosting.yaml` to include `build` and `release` configurations for Firebase App Hosting, ensuring correct deployment of the Vite application.

## 6. Immediate Next Steps

1.  **Complete Admin Dashboard - Property Manager CRUD:** Focus on implementing the UI for listing, editing, and deleting property managers in `src/components/Admin/PropertyManagerManagement.tsx`.
2.  **Continue with Project Roadmap:** Begin implementing other core features as prioritized.
