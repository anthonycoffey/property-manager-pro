# Progress: Multi-Tenant ERP-Style Web Application

## 1. Current Status

The project has most recently completed Phase 1 of the "Dashboard Data Visualizations & Statistics" feature, focusing on non-Phoenix related data. This involved adding new dashboard tabs to user panels, creating backend aggregation functions, developing frontend chart components, and updating data models and Firestore indexes. A plan for integrating Phoenix API data for service request analytics (`docs/12-dashboard-phoenix-integration-plan.md`) has also been documented.

Prior to this, updates included login page accessibility enhancements and Twilio "Request Call" integration.

## 2. What Works / Completed (Newest First)

- **Dashboard Data Visualizations & Statistics - Phase 1 (Non-Phoenix Data) (Completed 2025-06-03):**
    - **Objective:** Implement initial dashboard statistics and visualizations for Admin, Organization Manager, and Property Manager roles.
    - **Data Model Enhancement:**
        - Added `totalUnits: number` to `Property` interface in `src/types/index.ts` and `PropertyData` in `functions/src/types.ts`.
        - Updated `CreatePropertyForm.tsx` and `EditPropertyModal.tsx` to include `totalUnits` field.
        - Updated `createProperty.ts` and `updateProperty.ts` Cloud Functions to handle `totalUnits`.
    - **Backend Aggregation Cloud Functions:**
        - Created `functions/src/callable/getAdminDashboardStats.ts`: Aggregates platform-wide counts, user/org growth trends, and campaign overview.
        - Created `functions/src/callable/getOrgManagerDashboardStats.ts`: Aggregates organization-specific counts and campaign performance.
        - Created `functions/src/callable/getPropertyManagerDashboardStats.ts`: Aggregates property-specific counts (residents, occupancy) and campaign performance.
        - All three functions updated to robustly handle `request.data` being null or undefined.
        - Exported new functions in `functions/src/index.ts`.
    - **Frontend Chart Components (`src/components/Dashboard/Charts/`):**
        - Created `KpiCard.tsx`, `LineChart.tsx`, `BarChart.tsx`, `PieChart.tsx`, `GaugeChart.tsx`.
        - Installed `highcharts` and `highcharts-react-official` dependencies.
    - **Dashboard Panel Integration:**
        - `AdminDashboardPanel.tsx`: Added "Dashboard" tab; integrated KPIs, Line charts, Pie chart via `getAdminDashboardStats`.
        - `OrganizationManagerDashboardPanel.tsx`: Added "Dashboard" tab; integrated KPIs, Bar chart via `getOrgManagerDashboardStats`.
        - `PropertyManagerDashboardPanel.tsx`: Added "Dashboard" tab; integrated KPIs, Bar chart via `getPropertyManagerDashboardStats`.
    - **Firestore Indexes (`firestore.indexes.json`):**
        - Added collection group indexes for `properties`, `residents`.
        - Added collection group index for `campaigns` including `organizationId`.
        - Removed JSON comments.
    - **Documentation:**
        - Created `docs/12-dashboard-phoenix-integration-plan.md`.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level from `projectRoadmap.md` and recent work)

1.  **Dashboard Data Visualizations & Statistics - Phase 1.C (Phoenix API Integration):**
    *   **Objective:** Integrate service request analytics from Phoenix API into dashboards.
    *   **Status:** Pending Phoenix API documentation for querying aggregated job data.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Review Phoenix API documentation.
        *   Refine scope of service request stats based on API capabilities.
        *   Implement/update Cloud Functions (`getAdminServiceRequestStats`, `getOrgServiceRequestStats`, `getPropertyManagerServiceRequestStats`) to fetch and process data from Phoenix.
        *   Integrate new charts for service request analytics into the respective dashboard panels.
        *   Reference `docs/12-dashboard-phoenix-integration-plan.md`.
2.  **Phoenix Integration - Remaining Core Tasks:**
    *   Implement job/service request querying by various roles (Resident, PM, OM) from Property Manager Pro to Phoenix.
    *   Further develop the service request dispatch lifecycle beyond initial submission (e.g., status updates via webhooks from Phoenix to PMP, cancellation flows).
    *   Implement services querying from Phoenix for display/management within PMP if needed beyond the service type dropdown in the request form.
3.  **Dashboard Statistics - Denormalization & Optimization:**
    *   Monitor performance of current direct aggregation Cloud Functions.
    *   Iteratively implement denormalized counters (updated by Firestore triggers) for high-cost or frequently accessed statistics to improve scalability and reduce read costs, as per the hybrid aggregation strategy.
4.  **Review and Refine User Experience for Dashboards:**
    *   Gather feedback on the initial dashboard implementations.
    *   Consider adding date range filters or other interactivity as needed.
    *   Ensure accessibility and responsiveness of all charts.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **Phoenix API Documentation for Aggregated Queries:** Currently a blocker for Phase 1.C of dashboard statistics.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions (Newest First)

- **Dashboard Statistics Aggregation Strategy (2025-06-03):** Adopted a hybrid approach: direct aggregation via Cloud Functions initially, with iterative denormalization for scalability. Cloud Functions to be resilient to missing `request.data`.
- **Dashboard Layout Components (2025-06-03):** Prioritize MUI `Box` (with Flexbox) and `Stack` for dashboard layouts.
- **Charting Library (2025-06-03):** Confirmed use of `Highcharts` with `highcharts-react-official`.
- **Firestore Indexing for Dashboards (2025-06-03):** Added necessary collection group indexes for `properties`, `residents`, and `campaigns` to `firestore.indexes.json`.
- **`totalUnits` Field for Properties (2025-06-03):** Added to data model and relevant forms/functions to enable occupancy calculations.
- **(Older decisions as previously listed)**
